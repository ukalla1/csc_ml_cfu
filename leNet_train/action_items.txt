1. move the get_custom_matrix func into the custom tf lib
	1.1 this should open the path to bake the csc params into the tflite model
		1.1.1 these params offer new loop limits and in-turn latency savings on mobile and edge setups
2. elaborate the csc-fc in cpp (refer to the code for regular fc, small modification will accomplish our goal)
